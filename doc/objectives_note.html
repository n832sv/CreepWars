<span size='x-large' underline='low'>About</span>
This is a Human-vs-Human map, each team consists of 1-3 human leaders (2-3 recommended), and a minor AI side.

Each AI side always generates units so that the total number of them is <b>#creepwars_creep_count</b>.
Humans cannot recruit additional units, but they can spend their gold in Shop to buy upgrades.

To start the game, go to Shop, choose how you want to upgrade your Leader, then move to the center and fight.

Each kill will increase <b>gold</b> and <b>creep strength</b> for your team.
Human leaders cannot fully die: if they get 'killed', they are teloperted home and spend 1 turn to restore.

To win the game, you must kill one of the enemy guards.

<span size='x-large' underline='low'>Gold</span>
Each kill gives you <b>#creepwars_gold_for_lvl0 + #creepwars_gold_per_creep_level*lvl</b> gold:
lvl0	lvl1	lvl2	lvl3	lvl4
#lvl0g	#lvl1g	#lvl2g	#lvl3g	#lvl4g	gold you get for creep kill, depending on its level
If you kill enemy leader, you get the value of your current <b>creep score</b> in gold, never above <b>#creepwars_gold_for_leaderkill_max</b>, rounded down.

<span size='x-large' underline='low'>Creep score</span>
Each kill gives your team some <b>creep score</b>. You can see the amount by hovering a unit (not implemented yet).
Formula: <b>(creep_cost ^ #creepwars_score_power) * #creepwars_score_multiplier</b>. Killing enemy leader gives <b>x2</b> of that amount.

<span size='x-large' underline='low'>Creep generation</span>
As said earlier, each AI side generates creeps for a total of <b>#creepwars_creep_count</b> at the beginning of its turn.
The cost of chosen creeps is equal to your <b>creep score</b>.
However, if your <b>creep score</b> is below <b>#creepwars_lvl0_barrier</b>, then only lvl0 units will be generated, and if your <b>creep score</b> is above <b>#creepwars_lvl3plus_barrier</b>, you get random lvl3 unit. If your score is much higher than unit cost, the unit will have additional 'boost'.

<span size='x-large' underline='low'>Guard health</span>
Your guard health starts with #creepwars_guard_hp_initial and increases by #guard_creep_hp (configurable, default 1) when killing a creep and by <b>3x</b> of that value when killing enemy leader.
It is permanently decreased when the guard is attacked (legacy feature, might be removed).
