<span size='x-large' underline='low'>About</span>
This is a Human-vs-Human map, each team consists of 1-3 human leaders (2-3 recommended), and a minor AI side.

To start the game, go to Shop, choose how you want to upgrade your Leader, then move to the center and fight.

Each kill will increase <span color='#FFE680'>gold</span> and <span color='#FF8080'>creep score</span> for your team.
If you lose all health, you are teloperted home and spend 1 turn to restore.

Each AI side always generates units so that the total number of them is <b>#creepwars_creep_count</b>.
Humans cannot recruit additional units, but they can spend their <span color='#FFE680'>gold</span> in Shop to buy upgrades.

To win the game, you must kill one of the enemy guards.

<span size='x-large' underline='low'>Gold</span>
Each creep kill gives <span color='#FFE680'>gold</span>. Hover a creep to see how much gold you'll get for killing it.
Killing enemy leader gives you the value of your current <span color='#FF8080'>creep score</span>, in gold.

<span size='x-large' underline='low'>Creep score</span>
Each kill gives your team some <span color='#FF8080'>creep score</span>.
Formula: <b>(creep_cost âŒƒ #creepwars_score_power) * #creepwars_score_multiplier</b>. Killing enemy leader gives <b>x2</b> of that amount.
Check the amount by hovering a creep.

<span size='x-large' underline='low'>Creep generation</span>
Each AI side generates creeps for a total of <b>#creepwars_creep_count</b> at the beginning of its turn.
The cost of chosen creeps is equal to your <span color='#FF8080'>creep score</span>.
However, if your <span color='#FF8080'>creep score</span> is below <b>#creepwars_lvl0_barrier</b>, then only lvl0 units will be generated, and if your <span color='#FF8080'>creep score</span> is above <b>#creepwars_lvl3plus_barrier</b>, you get random lvl3 unit. If your score is much higher than unit cost, the unit will have additional 'boost'.

<span size='x-large' underline='low'>Guard health</span>
Your guard health starts with #creepwars_guard_hp_initial and increases by #guard_creep_hp (configurable, default 1) when killing a creep and by <b>3x</b> of that value when killing enemy leader.
It is permanently decreased when the guard is attacked (legacy feature, might be removed).

<span size='x-large' underline='low'>Latest changes</span>
Balancing:
* Disallow very cheap lvl0 units (level=0 and cost < 12) (2017-12-13)
* Leveled-up creeps do not increase gold/creep score bonus for killing them anymore, which makes fighting those creeps harder. (Previously, you'd get more gold, more XP and more creep score because of the lvl-up.)
* leaderkill gold is limited to lvl3 creep gold * 3 (2017-11-29)
Features:
* Hover leaders to see their Upgrades.
* Basic support for foreign Eras -- downgrade leaders by default.
* Game reload possible! Finally. Creep score is preserved.
* Add more creep types.
