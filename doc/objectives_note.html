<span size='large'>Get started (for beginners)</span>
Go to Shop, choose how you want to upgrade your Leader, then move to the center and fight.

Each kill will increase <b>gold</b> and <b>creep strength</b> for your team.
Human leaders cannot fully die, but if they get 'killed', they are teloperted home and spend 1 turn to restore.
Killing enemy leaders is usually hard, but more rewarding (more on that below).

To win the game, you must kill one of the enemy guards.

<span size='large'>Gold</span>
Each kill gives you <b>#creepwars_gold_for_lvl0 + #creepwars_gold_per_creep_level*lvl</b> gold:
lvl0	lvl1	lvl2	lvl3	lvl4
#lvl0g	#lvl1g	#lvl2g	#lvl3g	#lvl4g	gold you get for creep kill, depending on its level
If you kill enemy leader, you get the value of your current <b>creep score</b> in gold, never above #creepwars_gold_for_leaderkill_max, rounded down.

<span size='large'>Creep score</span>
Each kill gives your team some <b>creep score</b>. You can see the amount by hovering a unit (not implemented yet).
Formula: <b>(creep_cost ^ #creepwars_score_power) * #creepwars_score_scale</b>. Killing enemy leader gives <b>x2</b> of that amount.

<span size='large'>Creep generation</span>
Each team always generates <b>#creepwars_creep_count</b> creeps at the beginning of AI turn.
The cost of chosen creeps is equal to your <b>creep score</b>.
However, if your <b>creep score</b> is below <b>#creepwars_lvl0_barrier</b>, then only lvl0 units will be generated, and if your <b>creep score</b> is above <b>#creepwars_lvl3plus_barrier</b>, you get random lvl3+ unit. If your score is much higher than unit cost, the unit will have additional 'boost'.

<span size='large'>Guard health</span>
Your guard health starts with #creepwars_guard_hp_initial and increases by #guard_creep_hp when killing a creep and by #guard_leader_hp when killing enemy leader.
It is permanently decreased when the guard is attacked (legacy feature, might be removed).
