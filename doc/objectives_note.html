<span size='large'>Upgrade your leader and fight for victory.</span>

<span size='large'>Get started</span>
Go to Shop, upgrade your unit (it is advised to spend at least 50 gold on Hitpoints for beginners).
After you've upgraded your hero, move to the center and fight.

Each kill will increase <b>gold</b> and <b>creep strength</b> for your team.
Human leaders cannot fully die, but if they get 'killed', they are teloperted home and spend 1 turn to restore.
Killing enemy leaders is usually hard, but more rewarding (more on that below).

To win the game, you must kill one of the enemy guards.

<span size='large'>Gold</span>
Each kill gives you <b>3 + 2*lvl</b> gold:
lvl0	lvl1	lvl2	lvl3	lvl4
3	5	7	9	11	gold you get for creep kill, depending on its level
If you kill enemy leader, you get as much gold as your current <b>creep score</b> (rounded down).

<span size='large'>Creep generation</span>
Each team generates <b>8</b> creeps at the beginning of AI turn.
If your <b>creep score</b> is below <b>#creepwars_lvl0_barrier</b>, only lvl0 units will be generated (randomly).
If your <b>creep score</b> is <b>#creepwars_lvl0_barrier..#creepwars_lvl3plus_barrier</b>, you get units that cost as much as your <b>creep score</b>.
If your <b>creep score</b> is <b>#creepwars_lvl3plus_barrier+</b>, a random lvl3 creep will be generated. If your <b>creep score</b> is more than 12.0 above this unit-s cost, the creep will be 'boosted' (+2 dmg, +1 strikes, +1 MP).

<span size='large'>Creep score</span>
Each kill gives your team some <b>creep score</b>. You can see the amount by hovering a unit (not implemented yet).
Formula: <b>(creep_cost ^ #creepwars_score_power) * #creepwars_score_scale</b>. Killing enemy leader gives <b>x2</b> of that amount.
