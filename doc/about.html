<span size='x-large' underline='low'>About</span>
This is a Human-vs-Human map. Each team consists of 1-3 human leaders (2-3 recommended), and a minor AI side.

To start the game, go to Shop, choose how you want to upgrade your Leader, then move to the center and fight. To win the game, kill one of the enemy guards.

<span size='x-large' underline='low'>Gold</span>
You get <span color='#FFE680'>gold</span> for each kill. First <b>#gold_kills_to_increase kills</b> give <span color='#FFE680'>#gold_start_p0 gold</span>, next <b>#gold_kills_to_increase kills</b> give <span color='#FFE680'>#gold_start_p1 gold</span>, next <b>#gold_kills_to_increase kills</b> kills give <span color='#FFE680'>#gold_start_p2 gold</span>, etc. Leader kill gives 4 times more gold, 4 kill count. On multi-side map, killing guard counts as 5 leader kills.

<span size='x-large' underline='low'>Shop</span>
You Leader cannot recruit, but you can spend gold in Shop to buy upgrades. Visiting Shop will also heal your leader.

<span size='x-large' underline='low'>Score</span>
The cost of new AI creeps is equal to your <span color='#FF8080'>score</span>.
You increase <span color='#FF8080'>score</span> with each kill. Only the number of killed units counts (leader kill counts same as creep kill).
Additionally, if your <span color='#FF8080'>score</span> is below <b>#creepwars_lvl0_barrier</b>, then only lvl0 units will be generated, and if your <span color='#FF8080'>score</span> is above <b>#creepwars_lvl3plus_barrier</b>, you get random lvl3 unit. If your score is much higher than unit cost, the unit will have additional ''boost''.

<span size='x-large' underline='low'>Other</span>
<b>Guard health</b> increases by 1 when killing a creep and by 3 when killing a leader.
The <b>Scoreboard</b> has the following format: ''<span color='#FF8080'>score</span>  <span color='#FFE680'>gold</span>  (total_kills  leader_kills)''.
